- Here is a link to our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?resource=download

### Project rationale: 
- We were curious about the salaries of professionals in the field as we are studying to become one of them. 
- It will be interesting to see what job title has the highest salary and where in the world might be the best place to be a data scientist. 

### Ideas for visualizations: 
- Pie chart by experience of the indivdual for each Job Title:
